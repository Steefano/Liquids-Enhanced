# Liquids Enhanced
Mod for Mindustry that adds features and blocks for enhancing the liquid pipeline.
# Installation
**Important**: This mod requires [multi-lib](https://github.com/younggam/multi-lib) to work. Please install that mod first if you want to play with this one.

To install this mod you can simply download the repository and add the files under the mod directory in your Mindustry files.
# Features
The mod is still a prototype and there's currently only one feature: liquid bottling.

With the addition of two blocks, the bottler and the unbottler, you can bottle liquids so to make them transportable like materials.
